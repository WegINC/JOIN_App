                            <h3>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h3>
                            <h4>Nature and Purpose of Processing</h4>
                            <p>When you access our website — i.e., if you do not register or otherwise provide
                                information — general information is automatically collected. This information (server
                                log files) includes things like the type of web browser, the operating system used, the
                                domain name of your internet service provider, your IP address, and similar data.</p>
                            <p>This information is processed for the following purposes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To ensure the smooth display and optimization of the website</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This data does not allow us to draw conclusions about your identity. However, we reserve
                                the right to retrospectively check the server log files if there are concrete
                                indications of unlawful use.</p>

                            <h4>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest</h4>
                            <p>Processing is carried out pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest
                                in improving the stability and functionality of our website and ensuring system security
                                and misuse detection.</p>

                            <h4>Recipients</h4>
                            <p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as data processors for
                                the operation and maintenance of our website.</p>

                            <h4>Retention Period</h4>
                            <p>Data in server log files that enable identification of data subjects are stored for a
                                maximum of 14 days, unless a security-related event (e.g., DDoS attack) occurs.</p>
                            <p>In the event of such an incident, the server log files are stored until the incident is
                                resolved and fully clarified.</p>

                            <h4>Provision Mandatory or Required</h4>
                            <p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually
                                required. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website
                                are not guaranteed. Some services may also be unavailable or limited.</p>

                            <h4>Right to Object</h4>
                            <p>See the section below on your right to object under Article 21 GDPR.</p>

                            <p>Nature and Purpose of Processing</p>
                            <p>Our website includes a contact form that can be used to contact us electronically. If a
                                user uses this option, the data entered in the input fields will be transmitted to us
                                and stored.</p>
                            <p>You may also contact us via the email addresses provided. In this case, the personal data
                                transmitted with the email, such as the date and time the email was sent, email address,
                                IP address, and details of the servers involved, will be stored.</p>
                            <p>Regardless of the communication method used, we collect the content of your inquiry. Your
                                data is stored for the purpose of individual communication with you.</p>

                            <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
                            <p>The data is processed based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).</p>
                            <p>Our legitimate interest in processing your data is to facilitate easy communication with
                                you.</p>
                            <p>If you contact us to request an offer, data processing is also carried out for the
                                performance of pre-contractual measures (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR).</p>

                            <h4>Recipients</h4>
                            <p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as data processors for
                                the operation and maintenance of our website.</p>

                            <h4>Retention Period</h4>
                            <p>Data will be deleted no later than six months after the contact has been processed.</p>
                            <p>If a contractual relationship arises, we are subject to the statutory retention periods.
                                These are generally 6 or 10 years for reasons of proper bookkeeping and tax regulations.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Provision Mandatory or Required</h4>
                            <p>The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only process your
                                request if you provide us with the necessary data and the reason for your inquiry.</p>

                            <h4>Right to Object</h4>
                            <p>See the section below on your right to object under Article 21 GDPR.</p>

                            <h3>Creating a Customer Account</h3>
                            <h4>Nature and Purpose of Processing</h4>
                            <p>Our website gives you the opportunity to create a customer account. We collect your
                                contact details and link your purchases to your account.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the data you provide, we store the following data at the time the customer
                                account is created:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
                            <p>The processing of the data entered during registration is based on the user’s consent
                                (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).</p>

                            <h4>Recipients</h4>
                            <p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as data processors for
                                the operation and maintenance of our website.</p>

                            <h4>Retention Period</h4>
                            <p>Data will only be processed as long as the corresponding consent exists.</p>

                            <h4>Provision Mandatory or Required</h4>
                            <p>Creating a customer account is voluntary. It is beneficial, but not necessary, to fulfill
                                a contract with you or to carry out pre-contractual measures. You may always place
                                orders as a guest.</p>

                            <h4>Withdrawal of Consent</h4>
                            <p>You can delete your customer account at any time by contacting us using the contact

                            <h3>Right to Object on a Case-by-Case Basis</h3>
                            <p>You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular
                                situation, to the processing of your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (data
                                processing on the basis of a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling based
                                on this provision as defined by Art. 4(4) GDPR.</p>
                            <p>If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate
                                compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights,
                                and freedoms, or the processing serves to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
